#Self-Assessment

My role in the project was to develop machine learning and to process the data that we get.
One challenge was to implement all the knowledge and extra research to the project. 
I think the difficult part was to process the data. To manupulate and change the information so that we can use it.
So, what I did was to look again to the programs that were already made and also to search responses on Internet.

#Team Assessment
What we do, was to separate the activities. We communicate a lot to select what to do, how to do it and the responsable.
I think that one strenght was that we know how to research. So we can support in many topics.
One tip could be to take some time at the begining to discuss the knowledge of every member, and then assign topics.

#Summary of Project
Presents a cohesive, three- to four-sentence
summary of the project that could be used on a
LinkedIn profile, in an interview or cover letter, or
as an elevator pitch, including all of the following:
✓ Topic addressed
✓ Machine module used
✓ Results of the analysis 
For the project we what to create a model of prediction to approve credit cards. We decide to use some database from kaggle and to use python to manage analysis.
We use neuronal networks for the model. And we create a model that is able to predict if the customer has a high risk for the bank or not.
